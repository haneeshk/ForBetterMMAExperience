analogues that micmic the architecture of  bone and nacre have created (Munz, \
Tomsia, Ritchie). A develeopement aimed in the same direction is \n\
themimicking the design of pther biomaterials. (Recently to this category has \
been added coaxial glass from materine sponges.) Most notably, the designs \
found in marine glass rods. This kind translation is also being performed on \
the mechanical design found in marine glass rods (cite Jordan Raney, There \
have been recent efforts at reproducing the mechanical design of marine glass \
rod with tacit assumption such a design would inevitably lead toughness \
enhancements.). However, thezse recent efforts is not same at the initial \
efforts. For instance, the toughness of glass rod has not been directly \
measured. The efforts appaesr to be motivated by the tacit assumption layers \
would always enhance toughness.  The primary experimental data/evidence that \
is tacitly used as evidence to support the implicit hypothesis that marine \
glass rod are tough  come from observation of strair-step pattersn.  However, \
we shown in our that the observation strair-step pattern alone is \
insuffcieinet evidence that the lamellar architecture in glass rod is \
enahcing their work of fracture. We show that the strain-step patter that \
appears indistinguisable from patteras cxreated by  genuine toughnes \
enhancing mechanisms could alternately appear from slip events. \n\nThere are \
genuine cases where the toughn enhancing mechanism does lead to strair step \
patter. However, our shows that appearane of stair-step pattern does \
neccessary evidence of toughness enahcning mechanisms. The main point of our \
paper is that these recent micmiking efforts would better their  goal if they \
are precedieded by experimental detemination of the toughness of the \
